Yamboy1's rewrite of [Discord Donuts](https://github.com/mastercraft852/discord-donuts).

## What's Better
- Commands are now multiple files.
- **THE DATABASE ISN'T A JSON!!!**
- Keeps persistent data for orders.

## Selfhosting Instructions
1. Rename `auth.json.example` to `auth.json`
2. Edit auth.json accordingly.
3. Open a command prompt in the main directory, and run `node index.js`
>If you can't run that, you need to install node. Search it up.
